# ðŸš€ **Project: Building a Small Retrieval Search System from Scratch**  
_(Topic Clustering & Modeling)_

I developed an **end-to-end retrieval system**, including **topic clustering** and **topic modeling**, using **BERTopic**.  
This project provides a **step-by-step breakdown** of how a **search system** functions.  

ðŸ”¹ **Techniques Used:**  
- **BERTopic** for topic modeling ie naming the clusters .  
- **Clustering** with HDBSCAN.  
- **Retrieval System** to organize and retrieve information efficiently.  

ðŸ“Œ **Note:**  
Some concepts, such as **HDBSCAN** and **detailed internals of BERTopic**, are still under exploration.  
However, this system is fully built and **visually demonstrates how topic modeling works**.

This project offers a **practical implementation** of retrieval-based search systems! ðŸš€  
Let me know if you'd like further improvements. ðŸ”¥
